# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview

As people are becoming more health conscious and environmentally-friendly, finding alternative sources of protein is a hot topic.  Improbable Beef is a company trying to snythesize beef from algae, fungi, and bacteria.  It has a hypothesis that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef is from a human's belly button.  Therefore, volunteers were recruited to provide samples of navel bacteria for further research.

## Results

A webpage was created to include navel data from all volunteers.  Three types of charts (bar chart, bubble chart, and gauge chart) were generated to display information from each volunteer.  The bar chart documents the top 10 bacteria cultures found, the bubble chart showcases the amount of bacteria cultures per sample, and the gauge chart indicates belly button washing frequency.  Basic demographic information of each volunteer is also listed.  Volunteers are given subject ID numbers to ensure privacy.  Images of the aforementioned webpage and charts are shown below.
